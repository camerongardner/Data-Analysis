# Data Analysis of Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior

## Overview

This project is part of my continuous effort as a software engineer to develop deeper data analysis skills using Python. The software analyzes a publicly available dataset to draw insights and answer specific questions about the data. This project is an opportunity to sharpen skills in data processing, cleaning, and visualization, leveraging popular Python libraries.

**Dataset Description**:  
The dataset used for this project comes from [Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset). It contains [brief description of the data, such as number of rows, columns, and the type of data].

**Purpose**:  
The primary goal of this project is to develop a Python-based data analysis tool that answers predefined questions by processing and analyzing the data. The script demonstrates the usage of various data manipulation techniques such as filtering, aggregation, and visualization.

**Video Demo**:  
Watch the video demonstration of the project, walkthrough of the code, and explanation on how the programm works.

## Possibe Improvements

This project provides a foundation for data analysis, and I plan to enhance it further. Below are some areas for improvement and future additions:

* **Optimization**: Improve the visability and readability of the  charts generated.
* **Extended Analysis**: Explore deeper insights by posing additional questions to the dataset.
* **Filter Data Based on User Input**: Provide the user the ability to select columns to be filtered.
