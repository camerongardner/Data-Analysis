# Data Analysis of Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior

## Overview

This project is part of my continuous effort as a software engineer to develop deeper data analysis skills using Python. The software analyzes a publicly available dataset to draw insights and answer specific questions about the data. This project is an opportunity to sharpen skills in data processing, cleaning, and visualization, leveraging popular Python libraries.

**Dataset Description**:  
The dataset used for this project comes from [Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset). It contains [brief description of the data, such as number of rows, columns, and the type of data].

**Purpose**:  
The primary goal of this project is to develop a Python-based data analysis tool that answers predefined questions by processing and analyzing the data. The script demonstrates the usage of various data manipulation techniques such as filtering, aggregation, and visualization.

**Video Demo**:  
Watch a video demonstration of the project, including a walkthrough of the code, results, and insights.

## Data Analysis Results

Here are the questions this analysis aimed to answer:

1. **Question 1**  
   _Answer_: App usage based on age and battery drain.
   
2. **Question 2**  
   _Answer_: Data usage in relation to app usage time and device model.

3. **Question 2**  
   _Answer_: Impact of the number of installed apps on data usage and app usage time.

## Possibe Additions

This project provides a foundation for data analysis, and I plan to enhance it further. Below are some areas for improvement and future additions:

* **Optimization**: Improve the visability and readability of the  charts generated.
* **Extended Analysis**: Explore deeper insights by posing additional questions to the dataset.
* **Filter Data Based on User Input**: Provide the user the ability to select columns to be filtered.
